# Tribute Page

## About
This simple HTML and CSS webpage was my first project since learning to code again. The guidelines for the project were set forth by freeCodeCamp. Basically, just create a basic webpage dedicated to something, giving basic facts and information. This was truly my first tinkering with CSS, and I remember learning a lot then, and learning a whole lot more since then.
